## Content: Introduction and Foundations
## Project: Titanic Survival Exploration

## Project Overview

In this ***optional*** project, I created decision functions that attempted to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. I started with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.
