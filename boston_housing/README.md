## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview
In this project, I applied machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I first explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. I then analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enabled me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I tested this optimal model on a new sample and compared the predicted selling price to my statistics.
