    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement code to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods(AdaBoost):\n",
    "1. One real-world application applying the Ensemble Methods and particularly AdaBoost is in \"Customer Churn Prediction\" model (https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/PatternRecognition/slides/churn_adaboost.pdf), since this model is very useful in predictive binary classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The strength of the model is that not only the complexity of the data doesn't affect it nagatively but also improves its accuracy and F1 score. Also, its training and predicting time is very reasonable. AdaBoost also can be used to boost the performance of any machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The weakness of the model is that the model is like a multilayer classifier which requires multiple classifiers to apply to get to the final result. This means more storage and runtime. Therefore, they can become costly in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since we're doing a binary classification task on whether a person makes more that $50,000 or not, Ensemble Method can be a great candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One real-world application of Decision Trees model could be \"Credit Card Fraud Detection\" (https://www.ijcsmc.com/docs/papers/April2015/V4I4201511.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decision Trees model has multiple benefits. First, it is easy to implement and fast to run. Second, it can do the prediction decision based on all of the consideration for each branch's outcome,  while it is capable of feature selection, as well. Also, it can be used for both numerical and categorical data, and even for data with high uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The weakness of Decision Trees is the fact that they tend to overfit. Since they are capable of including so many features, sometimes they go overfitted. So, we can fix it by trying different number of features or number of nodes in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Decision Trees can be a good candidate for this problem, since they are very fast and accurate for classification tasks. However we should be cautious about its overfitting tendecy especially with hight number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One real-world application of SVM is \"Face Detection from Images\" (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f864/10bdcc2848f4d719c797466c4851565d17e3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machine models are very useful models for both regression and classification task. Its strength is utilizing kernel trick which means it can be applien on even very complex data by using an appropriate kernel function. One of its proiorities is maximizing margin which provides generalization and lower risk of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The weakness of the model is its high cost of hardware and runtime for large datasets. SVMs are not easy to understand and interpret. They can be very good models only if the good kernel function is chosen which is not very easy to find. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. SVMs are very powerful in classifying non-linear data. That's why I chose it as one of my options, however, after trying it, it turns out to need a very high cost of training and predicting time comparing to the other two model while its accuracy score and F1 score is still less than AdaBoost."

    "* The chosen model for identifying individuals that make `more than $50,000` for Charity ML is AdaBoost classifier. AdaBoost is one of the Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning which works particularly well in binary classifications (like what we have here: classifying people in 2 categories where they either make `more than $50,000 or at most $50,000`). This method acts like boosting the performance of the other models that hasn't done a great prediction individually. \n",

Next model does the training and enhances the previous prediction and this way the prediction get improved in every step, while doesn't overfit the data. As shown in the visualizations as well, it has a high accuracy score and F1 score in both training and testing set, with a reasonble training and predicting time. Another great point about it is the fact that the dataset enlargement doesn't affect the result much."

However, I was wrong about my most important feature, \"workclass\" which is not in the five most important features and I didn't consider \"capital-loss\" since I thought capital gian is more determinative. I was right about the other four features \"age, capital gain, hours-per-week, education-num\", with a little different order, though. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "Final model's accuracy score and F-score have reduced a little compare to these scores when all features are used. Accuracy score has reduced from 0.8645 to 0.8379 , and F-score from 0.7375 to 0.6898. Depending on the problem I'll consider using the reduced data or not. If training time is a factor, I'll use the reduced data, since the difference in the scores is not high. However, if we're doing predictions for a high risk task, let's say a medical task or credit fraudulent prediction, we might prefer not to sacrifice accuracy for speed."
